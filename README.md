## Simulation on the unit circle S^1

For simulations on the unit circle, run `s1_simulation.R`. It stores the simulation results in files begins with `s1_result_`. 

To generate plot like Figure 1 the paper, run `s1_plot.R`. The plot is stored in `s1.png`.

## Simulation on the Euclidean space R

## Simulation on the unit sphere S^2

For simulations on the unit circle, run `sphere_simulation.R`. It stores the simulation results in files begins with `sphere_compare_result_`. 

To generate plot like Figure 1 the paper, run `sphere_plot.R`. The plot is stored in `sphere_compares.png`.
